- Limited Disk Storage in Free Colab Account ~84 GB

## **🚨 NOTE:**

- Video Splitting is intentionally disabled to avoid video corruptions. Instead, they are zipped if they exceed MAX_UPLOAD_SIZE
<!-- - Magnet or Torrent Links are supported, But avoid using, because `Google Colab Strictly Prohibits Torrents` -->
- Downloading `YouTube Video without permission of the owner` can lead to copyright issues. Use with Caution
